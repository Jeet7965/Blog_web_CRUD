This project demonstrates how to implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blog posts.

Create: Users can add new blog posts with a title and content and Image using Multer packeg.

Read: All posts are displayed on the homepage, and each post can be viewed individually in Details.

Update: Existing blog posts can be edited and updated through an edit form.

Delete: Posts can be removed permanently from the database.

The application uses Express.js for backend routing, EJS for rendering dynamic pages, and Mongoose for interacting with the MongoDB database. 
This project helped me understand how to integrate backend logic with a templating engine and manage data persistence efficiently.
